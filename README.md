# Vision
Experimental Neural Network basic classes in C++ to explore the inner workings of an Artificial neural Network.
This project contains all basic neuron and neuron layers classes to create a simple neural network.

#future
I intend to add training methods in the future and upgrade it to convolutional neural network. 

#Aim
The aim of the project is to create a framework for creating a neural network capable of image and text recognition. Later into the future, I hope to create interconnected neural networks, controlled by a central server. A cloud network of neural networks capable of complex actions, able to recognize content of images, texts and web pages and also remembering.
